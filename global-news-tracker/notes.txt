1. Use `feedparser` to get headlines and links from RSS.
2. Use `newspaper3k` to extract full content from each link.
3. Feed the content to LLM for summarization.



✅ feedparser
→ Reads the RSS feed (XML) from a news site
→ Gives you: 

        entry.title → Headline
        entry.link → URL of the article
        entry.published → Date
        entry.summary → Teaser (optional)

RSS is like a news bulletin board for the internet.
Instead of visiting websites to check for new content, RSS lets you subscribe to updates and receive them automatically.



✅ newspaper3k
→ Takes the entry.link (the article URL)
→ Downloads and parses the full article page
→ Gives you:

        article.text → Full clean content
        article.title, article.authors, article.publish_date, etc.
