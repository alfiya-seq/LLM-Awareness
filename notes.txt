summary table
| Keyword             | Meaning                                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `open("file", "r")` | Open file in read mode                    |
| `open("file", "w")` | Open in write mode                        |
| `with ... as ...`   | Context manager – ensures safe open/close |
| `f.read()`          | Reads file content                        |
| `f.write("text")`   | Writes text to file                       |

✅ with open(...) as f:
This is a cleaner and safer way to open files. It automatically:
Opens the file
Assigns it to variable f
Closes it automatically after you're done
You can think of it like a temporary helper:

“Hey Python, open this file, let me use it as f, and once I’m done, please close it.”
